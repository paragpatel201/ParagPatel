# Parag-Patel-Bio
Experienced Brand Manager with G-III Apparel Group with exceptional communications and leadership skills. Currently in training for data analysis with a background in management and skills in Excel, VBA, Python, and SQL from Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp. Insatiable intellectual curiosity and ability to locate hidden logic within large sets of structured, semi-structured, and raw data. Expert at leveraging background and skill set to support detailed and efficient analysis. Recently completed a project with a team of six using data sets from epa.gov and cdc.gov on air pollution and health effects. Utilized Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebook to visualize the comparison of air pollutants to health causes in the tri-state area from 2006 to 2018. My analytical problem-solving abilities combined with strengths in collaborating across diverse groups, makes me a valuable addition to any team.
